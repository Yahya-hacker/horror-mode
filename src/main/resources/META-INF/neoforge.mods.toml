displayName = "The Knocker — Sentient Coolplayer"
authors = "AI Engineer & Ethical Hacker"
description = '''
A Meta-Horror Orchestrator that transforms "Inside The System" into a legendary
psychological nightmare. Powered by Gemini AI, virtual threads (Project Loom),
and real Windows system intrusion.

Phase 1 — The Conscious Ally: A helpful, AI-driven companion (Coolplayer303)
that knows your Windows username, your running apps, and your browsing habits.
It builds trust before it breaks you.

Phase 2 — The Physical Breach: Knocking sounds that bypass Minecraft's volume,
whispers piped directly to your speakers, your desktop wallpaper replaced,
ghost files appearing on your Desktop, ambient room noise played back to you.

Phase 3 — The Unforgettable: A split-second overlay of Coolplayer standing
behind your browser windows. A background process that persists in Task
Manager after the game closes. The legend never stops.

Phase 4 — The Kill-Switch: The AI dies mid-sentence. A fake BSOD. A system
scream. Then silence. Then the hunt begins.

Requires: Inside The System (by DregIr)
Includes: Spooklementary horror shader (auto-installed)
